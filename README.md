# leo_ho_sim_matlab_2024
A time-step based MATLAB simulator for 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). This project implements a LEO satellite constellation (600 km) with an Earth-moving cell scenario for handheld UEs, based on 3GPP TR 38.821. It includes a hybrid handover mechanism based on signal strength, distance, and time.
